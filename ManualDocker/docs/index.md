# SAPP
**Semantic Annotation Platform with Provenance**

SAPP is a Semantic Annotation Platform with Provenance and is designed on the basis of Semantic Web.
The platform or its modules allows you to annotate genomes of various qualities with the full chain of provenance.
Resulting is a RDF genome data model which you can query and analyse using SPARQL.
Various modules are available which allows you to annotate, visualize and export to various formats.

For a global overview of the modules available look under the Modules section on the left. The modules are broken up into three subsections. The **Conversion** section, allowing to convert various formats to the RDF data model. **Genetic elements** contains modules for the prediction of Crispr repeats, genes, tRNA, tmRNA and rRNAs with each containing a corresponding RDF model. **Protien annotation** contains modules to further annotate the proteins either predicted using the gene prediction module or through the conversion modules.
